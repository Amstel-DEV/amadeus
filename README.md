# Amadeus
A side project that aims to recreate the Amadeus System shown in Steins;Gate 0.

Original AMADEUS could store and recall information from previous interactions, providing a personalized experience to users. This project may not be able to fully replicate memory storage as depicted in the anime, thus weâ€™ll simulate it by designing a system that stores user preferences, interaction history, and context to provide a more personalized experience.

# Future Updates
This project is only a side project of mine so expect a slow development phasing for this project since I'm all by my self making this project, but I will do my best to give an update monthly for this project.
