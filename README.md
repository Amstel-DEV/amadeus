# Amadeus
A side project that aims to recreate the Amadeus System shown in Steins;Gate 0.

This project will not have the capability to store one's person memories like the original AMADEUS SYSTEM due to our current technology, even though this project strives to make the AMADEUS SYSTEM come to life.

I'm continuing what Yink have started, since Yink takes more focus on the design over the actual functionality, though this project of mine will start from scratch and focuses more on the functionality and capabilities.

# Future Updates
This project is only a side project of mine so expect a slow development phasing for this project since I'm all by my self making this project, but I will do my best to give an update monthly for this project.
